## What is virtual DOM

virtual-dom is a subset of the DOM. The DOM is not ubiquitous and has a vast
API.

The primary role of virtual-dom is to provide a concise, environment-independent
representation of HTML.

Therefore, all DOM methods and members that are not needed to do declarative
HTML are removed.

In other words, virtual-dom is a feature-restricted DOM representation for
declarative HTML.
